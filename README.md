# React app using Materialize CSS

These projects demonstrate how to use Material CSS in React App instead of relying on the available react wrapper out there.

Reasons:

1.  Wrapper may not have all the features.
2.  Constrainted by the wrapper for bug fix and updates
3.  Usage is totally different with Materialize CSS and is dependent on the wrapper
4.  Difficult to troubleshoot
5.  Knowledge of Materialize CSS is wasted
